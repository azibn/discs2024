The UKI discs meeting aims to bring together the different disc communities across the UK & Ireland for those working on astrophysical discs. We are delighted to announce the first conference of this series will be hosted at the University of Warwick on 9th-11th September 2024! The theme of the conference will be _Protoplanetary Discs and Debris Discs (including White Dwarf Derbis Discs)_, covering both observations and theory. Scientific topics include but are not limited to Disc formation and evolution, Planet-disc interactions, disc and planetary dynamics, environmental effects on discs, disc chemistry, exocomets, etc.

## Code of Conduct 

(Adapted RAS and UKEXOM2023)

We value the participation of all conference attendees and want to ensure everyone will have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Therefore, all attendees are expected to show respect towards other attendees and agree to the code of conduct upon registration and attendance.

This meeting will be a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, nationality, and religion. We do not tolerate harassment of attendees in any form.

- Presenters give their time freely. Many have travelled a considerable distance, some are very distinguished, and some are early career scientists perhaps giving a talk at this level for the first time. All deserve a fair and encouraging hearing. Please try to be on time for the start of a session, or otherwise enter quietly into the room, refrain from loud conversations outside the doors and switch off mobile phones, and if you must use a laptop, do so inconspicuously in one of the rear seats.

- Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

- All communication given by presenters, organisers and attendees should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language, jokes and imagery is not appropriate for any event.

- Be kind to other participants and respect local staff. Do not insult or put down other attendees.

- Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

- Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the event, without a refund of any charge.
