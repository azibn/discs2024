<p>Although the closest train station to campus is Canley station (a 30 minute walk), there are no transport links from that station to campus.

<p>Coventry station is served by 4 train companies (Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, West Midlands, and London Northwestern), and is located on the West Coast Main Line (among others), linkning London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Lancaster, Edinburgh and Glasgow. Coventry station also connects to the Cross Country Route (linking Aberdeen, Newcastle, York, Leeds, Sheffield, Derby, Bristol, Exeter and Penzance) through an easy transfer at Birmingham New Street station.</p>
