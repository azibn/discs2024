<p>Registration for this conference is <strong>free!</strong> Information for abstract submissions for talks/posters is below.</p>

<p>The conference includes 3 days of traditional conference talks, but also with a mix of “new” sessions that will be trialled too. This is in the works, but could include a Careers session for early-career researchers/or an EDI session in Astronomy. The SOC will select talks with the aim of ensuring that a range of topics are presented, that priority is given to early-career researchers, and that those from under-represented groups in astronomy receive an opportunity to present their work.</p>

<p>We aim to ensure that everyone who submits an abstract will be able to present their work. While it is not guaranteed you will be given a talk, we can promise to invite you to present a poster.</p>
