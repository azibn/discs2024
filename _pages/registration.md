Registration for this conference is **free!** Information for abstract submissions for talks/posters is below.

The conference includes 3 days of traditional conference talks and discussion sessions, with an EDI session in Astronomy embedded in the programme. The SOC will select talks with the aim of ensuring that a range of topics are presented, that priority is given to early-career researchers, and that those from under-represented groups in astronomy have an opportunity to present their work. We will host the conference in hybrid format, though only a limited number of talks will be given online.

We aim to ensure that everyone who submits an abstract will be able to present their work, either as a talk or as a poster.

## Registration

Register for the conference and submit your abstract here! Don't worry if your science is not entirely ready now, we will give those who have preliminarily registered the option to update your abstracts closer to the conference.
