Registration for this conference is **free!** Information for abstract submissions for talks/posters is below.

The conference includes 3 days of traditional conference talks and discussion sessions, with an EDI session in Astronomy embedded in the programme. The SOC will select talks with the aim of ensuring that a range of topics are presented, that priority is given to early-career researchers, and that those from under-represented groups in astronomy receive an opportunity to present their work. The new sessions are currently in the works, but would include an EDI session in Astronomy. We are exploring the options to host the conference in a hybrid format, though talks will be in-person only.    

We aim to ensure that everyone who submits an abstract will be able to present their work. While it is not guaranteed you will be given a talk, we can promise to invite you to present a poster.
