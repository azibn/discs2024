Registration for this conference is **free!** Information for abstract submissions for talks/posters is below.

The conference will consist of 3 days of traditional conference talks, but also with a mix of "new" sessions that will be trialled too. This is in the works, but could include a Careers session for Early-Careers and/or an EDI session in Astronomy. The SOC will select talks with the aim of ensuring that a range of topics are presented, that priority is given to early career researchers, and that those from under-represented groups in astronomy receive an opportunity to present their work.    

We aim to ensure that everyone who submits an abstract will be able to present their work. While it is not guaranteed they will be given a talk, we can promise that inviting you to present your work as a poster will be guaranteed.
