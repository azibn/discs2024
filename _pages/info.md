The UKI Discs Meeting will be held in the [Zeeman Building](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk//search/623c8859421e6f5928c0c794) at the University of Warwick. The university is located on the outskirts of Coventry, about 3 miles to the city centre. The town of Kenilworth is slightly closer (2 miles), but the small county town of Warwick is actually much further away (7 miles).

## Getting Here {#GettingHere}
### *Arriving by train*

The rail option with the most public transport options to help you get to the university campus is to arrive at Coventry station (not Warwick station). Coventry station is served by 4 train companies (Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, West Midlands, and London Northwestern), and is located on the West Coast Main Line (among others), linking London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Lancaster, Edinburgh and Glasgow. Coventry station also connects to the Cross Country Route (linking Aberdeen, Newcastle, York, Leeds, Sheffield, Derby, Bristol, Exeter and Penzance) through an easy transfer at Birmingham New Street station.

To get to campus, Coventry train station provides good bus (£2-£4, 15-30 min) and taxi/Uber (£10-15, 10-20 min) options. The buses to campus from Coventry Train Station are the [11](https://nxbus.co.uk/coventry/services-timetables/11-coventry-leamington-spa) and the [12X](https://nxbus.co.uk/coventry/services-timetables/12x-coventry-university-of-warwick), with the latter being a quicker option as it is a more direct route to the Warwick University Interchange. The [87](https://www.stagecoachbus.com/routes/midlands/87/solihull-coventry/xldo087.i) bus also passes around the campus, but does not stop at the main campus' University Interchange. Live bus schedules are linked with the respective route.

Alternatively, Canley station is another option to get to campus. It is a 25-minute walk or a 10 minute cycle to campus. There are no bus options from Canley station. 

### *Arriving by (long-distance) coach*

Coventry is served by both National Express and Megabus. The Coventry drop-off point for both companies is Coventry's main bus and coach hub, Pool Meadow Bus Station, in the city centre. The buses that run to campus from Coventry originate from Pool Meadow Bus Station and, on the way, also stop at Coventry railway station.

### *Arriving by car*

The postcode for the Central Campus is CV4 7AL. On approaches to Coventry, follow the signs to Warwick Arts Centre or the University of Warwick. Car Parks on campus are all controlled by ANPR. Check the [online interactive map](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/) to find the locations of various car parks.
